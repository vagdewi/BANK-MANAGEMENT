# BANK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

This is a basic banking system program written in Python. The program consists of two classes: Account and BankingSystem. The Account class represents a single user account and has methods to deposit, withdraw, get balance, and get mini statement. The BankingSystem class represents the overall banking system and has methods to create an account, login, and handle user transactions.

The program uses a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until the user chooses to exit. When the user chooses to create an account, the program prompts the user for a username and password and creates a new account with a default balance of 0. When the user chooses to login, the program prompts the user for a username and password and checks if the username and password are valid. If the login is successful, the program displays a menu of options to the user, including deposit, withdraw, check balance, get mini statement, and logout. The program repeats this menu until the user chooses to logout.

Overall, this program provides a basic framework for a banking system.
